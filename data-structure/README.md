# data structure and algorithm

>> Selection sort
given an array which consists of [8,2,5,7,4]
smallest is on the left
sorted_array = 
2,[8,5,7,4]
2,4,[5,7,8]
2,4,5,[7,8]
2,4,5,7,8

time complexity O(n^2)
space complexity O(1)

>> Insertion sort
given an array which consists of [5,7,1,4,3,2]
sorted list is on the left side, not sorted is on the right side. 
sorted_array = 
[5],[7,1,4,3,2]
[5,7],[1,4,3,2]
[1,5,7],[4,3,2]
[1,4,5,7],[3,2]
[1,3,4,5,7],[2]
[1,2,3,4,5,7]

time complexity O(n^2)
space complexity O(1)
